## Abstract
We propose a view-dependent adaptive subdivision algorithm for rendering parametric surfaces on parallel hardware. Our framework allows us to bound the screen space error of a piecewise linear approximation. We naturally assign more primitives to curved areas while keeping quads large for flatter parts of the model and avoid cracks resulting from the polygonal approximation of non-uniform patch subdivision. The overall algorithm is simple, fits current GPUs extremely well, and is surprisingly fast while producing little to no artifacts.
