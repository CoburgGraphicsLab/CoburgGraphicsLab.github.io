## Abstract
We propose a codec specifically designed for meshlet compression, optimized for rapid data-parallel GPU decompression within a mesh shader. Our compression strategy orders triangles in optimal generalized triangle strips (GTSs), which we generate by formulating the creation as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Our method achieves index buffer compression rates of 16:1 compared to the vertex pipeline and crack-free vertex attribute quantization based on user preference. The 15.5 million triangles of our teaser image decompress and render in 0.59 ms on an AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX.
