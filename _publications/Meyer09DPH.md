## Abstract
The efficient simulation of mutual light exchange for radiosity-like methods has been demonstrated on GPUs. However, those approaches require a suitable set of links and hierarchical data structures, prepared in an expensive preprocessing step. We present a fast, data-parallel method to create links and a compact tree of patches. We demonstrate our approach for Antiradiance and Implicit Visibility. Our algorithm is able to create up to 50 M links per second on an Nvidia GTX 260, allowing fully dynamic scenes at interactive frame rates.
