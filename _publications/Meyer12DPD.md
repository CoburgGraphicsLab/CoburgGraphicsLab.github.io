## Abstract
Abstract We propose a lossless, single-rate triangle mesh topology codec tailored for fast data-parallel GPU decompression. Our compression scheme coherently orders generalized triangle strips in memory. To unpack generalized triangle strips efficiently, we propose a novel parallel and scalable algorithm. We order vertices coherently to further improve our compression scheme. We use a variable bit-length code for additional compression benefits, for which we propose a scalable data-parallel decompression algorithm. For a set of standard benchmark models, we obtain (min: 3.7, med: 4.6, max: 7.6) bits per triangle. Our CUDA decompression requires only about 15\% of the time it takes to render the model even with a simple shader.
