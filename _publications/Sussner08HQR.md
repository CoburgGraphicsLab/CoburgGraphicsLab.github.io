## Abstract
Virtual interactive examination of the quality of car body surfaces is an important issue in the development process of a car. The method is based on simulating reflection lines using striped environment maps and strong specular highlights. For this purpose high quality meshes are created from the NURBS surfaces. However, the meshes have a fixed resolution, hence a closer examination requires a finer tessellation. In this paper we present a method which allows a view-dependent, arbitrary fine tessellation of trimmed NURBS surfaces at interactive frame rates.
